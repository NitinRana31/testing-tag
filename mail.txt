Dear Team,
I wanted to provide you with an update on the progress we have made regarding the deployment of the GC Commerce application on the Liberty server, which is currently running on WebSphere.
Current Status:
1.	Code Structure Exploration: We have explored the code structure and identified several services, which are integrated through a parent POM. The child POMs for these services are in place.
2.	Build Process: We are following a no-build stage approach and utilizing the command mvn clean package to build the code. This process successfully generates the target folder, which contains the EAR file. Additionally, we are including both the settings.xml and server.xml for the application deployment.
3.	We initially utilized the Liberty image provided by the Move2Kube tool; however, we encountered several issues. To resolve this, we reviewed multiple internal Confluence documents and collaborated with the Citi team. As a result, we opted to use a Citi-compliant Liberty image for our deployment. Additionally, we set up an automation process to replace the Move2Kube Liberty image with our Citi-compliant image.
4.	Deployment Steps:
o	We followed the instructions outlined in the Confluence page for deploying the EAR file on Liberty. The necessary configurations have been made in both the server.xml and Dockerfile.
o	In the Dockerfile, we included: 
	The p12 file and its password to address the SSL handshake error.
	Several environment variables.
	Database environment variables along with their respective values.
o	In the server.xml, we added: 
	A feature manager tag, incorporating the sub-tags required by the application team.
	The context root as provided by the application team.
5.	Ongoing Issues: We are actively in communication with the Liberty team. Currently, we are facing two critical issues:
o	The application is unable to connect to the database due to port blockage.
o	There are application errors related to Hibernate, which need to be addressed by the application team, as confirmed by the Liberty team.
